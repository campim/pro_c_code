### Examples of Oracle Pro\*C Code 

Author Daniel G. Campos 2008

This repository contains the following examples :

1. **exec_proc_oracle.pc  :** example of a call to a package.procedure inside Oracle from a Pro\*C code.

2. **generate_letters.pc  :** example of a call to a package.procedure inside Oracle, creation of text files from it, and execution of host commands from a Pro\*C code.

3. **insert_table_proc.pc :** example of an insert into a table with data read from a simple text file with Pro\*C code. In this example we use a typical C STRUCT structure to hold the data read from the text file.
